Original File: 348-686-Historical-ImmStateCounty.xlsx  
Source: These data are based on counts of students by immunization status in all grades (kindergartner through 12th grade) in public and private schools.  These data were reported to the Department of Health by 12/31/2016.  The student immunization status is based on parent reports to schools and may not be verified by a healthcare provider.  The department makes no other claims about the accuracy of the data as reported by schools.  
Title: State - all students, grades K-12, immunization data - school years 1998-99 to 2017-18  
Notes:   
Weighting of data: In school years 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, data for kindergartners and all students in grades K-12 is weighted to account for schools that did not report.  Data for other school years for kindergartners and all students in grades K-12 are unweighted.  Data for 6th graders is not weighted for any year.   
Changes in data collected: Before school year 2006-07, immunizations against pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus  were reported together.  Beginning in school year 2006-07, pertussis immunizations are reported separately from diphtheria and tetanus immunizations.							
Varicella vaccination has been reported since school year 2006-07, when it was first required for school entry. Before school years 2007-08, student counts include first graders in schools with no kindergarteners. Beginning in school year 2012-13, schools reported exemptions by exemption type (medical, personal, religious, and/or religious membership). Beginning in school year 2012-13, immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella are reported together as the MMR immunization.  Before 2012-13, each antigen is reported separately.
