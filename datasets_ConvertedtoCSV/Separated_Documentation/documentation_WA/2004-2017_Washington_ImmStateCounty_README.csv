Data Notes: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data Source: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,These data are based on counts of students by immunization status in all grades (kindergartner through 12th grade) in public and private schools.  These data were reported to the Department of Health by 12/31/2016.  The student immunization status is based on parent reports to schools and may not be verified by a healthcare provider.  The department makes no other claims about the accuracy of the data as reported by schools. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weighting of data:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"In school years 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, data for kindergartners and all students in grades K-12 is weighted to account for schools that did not report.  Data for other school years for kindergartners and all students in grades K-12 are unweighted.  Data for 6th graders is not weighted for any year.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
