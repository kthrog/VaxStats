,"These data are based on counts of students by immunization status in all grades (kindergartner through 12th grade) in public and private schools.  These data were reported to the Department of Health by 12/31/2013.  The student immunization status is based on parent reports to schools and may not be verified by a healthcare provider.  The department makes no other claims about the accuracy of the data as reported by schools.  The summary data in this report is not weighted and does not account for the percentage of schools that did not report.  Reporting status by school is available on the last worksheet (7.
