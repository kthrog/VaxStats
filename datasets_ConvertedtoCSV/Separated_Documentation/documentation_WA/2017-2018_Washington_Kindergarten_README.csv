Data Notes: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data Source: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"These data are based on counts of students by immunization status in kindergarten in public and private schools.  These data were reported to the Department of Health by 12/31/2017. The student immunization status is based on parent reports to schools and may not be verified by a healthcare provider. The department makes no other claims about the accuracy of the data as reported by schools. The summary data in this report is not weighted and does not account for the percentage of schools that did not report. Reporting status by school is available on the last worksheet (7. School) of this file. Note that some schools did report, but reported zero kindergartners in attendance (ex: middle and high schools).  Other schools report data but were excluded from this report - this includes schools located in hospitals and jails, parent partnership programs, schools located out of district, and online schools. Schools that had inaccurate or missing addresses were classified as ""unidentified"" for mapping to some jurisdictional boundaries covered in this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,
