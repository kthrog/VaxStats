**Definition, Scope, & Goals:** 
Vaccination frequently appears in the news due to prominent anti-vaxxer movements, and due to preventable disease outbreaks, such as measles, in states like Washington, New York, and California. Though the effectiveness of vaccination is well-established science, various groups continue to resist vaccination for various reasons, such as personal and religious beliefs. Data about vaccination rates, exemption rates, and vaccination-related (or lack thereof) disease outbreaks exists from sources such as the CDC and state-level Departments of Health, but this data is not centralized or normalized, due to the high variance in policies across states, counties, and localized areas, and due to the variance of recommended vaccines and their accompanying administration schedules. Additionally, as some states start to pass new vaccination laws to counter disease outbreaks (such as Washington’s HB 1638), it’s becoming increasingly important to understand the vaccination landscape, and how it intersects with legislation, research, freedom of expression, and public health. 
 
For the purposes of this project, the VaxStats repository will focus on vaccination and immunology data for school-age children in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), specifically the states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Data of particular interest includes vaccination and exemption rates, types of vaccines administered, and recommended vaccine schedules.
 
To fully understand how vaccination rates and disease outbreaks are related, and in order to prevent them in future, the VaxStats repository aims to:
- Provide a central repository for all vaccination data on school age children in the PNW, as well as related data like outbreak data and policy data
- Establish collection standards that allow disparate vaccination datasets to be discovered and compared
- Allow users to visualize multiple layers of data at once, through curation of data to improve interoperability and machine readability
 
**Audience:** 
The people who could be using this data might be legislators, public health officials, the general public, researchers, and social workers.

**Community Aspects:** 
It will be important to consider the current standards of public health organizations. It will also be very important to consider HIPAA, FERPA, and other privacy standards that are often tied to health data.

**Data:** 
Vaccination reporting data is primarily gathered by health departments and school districts. As there is no federal regulation that dictates how schools report the data, there is a fair amount of variation in the data provided by each school. Normalization of these datasets will constitute a large portion of our work, and will require the development of a new metadata schema that we can map the collected data to. Additionally, due to this high level of variance, we will need to develop a data quality typology, to set expectations for what can be reasonably done with different types of available data. 
The CDC provides a yearly report, known as the National Immunization Survey (NIS), on vaccination rates across the country at the state level, but does not include data at the state, county, or district level. The CDC also provides access to immunization and vaccination schedules, which is broken down by environmental requirements (hospital facility, school). Laws vary by state, and will need to be gathered from individual state legislatures.
WHO provides national vaccination rate estimates, pulling data from local and national reports, as well as outbreak reports. WHO also produces their own set of standards and norms for vaccination schedules, that will need to be considered when accessing and working with the data. UNICEF also provides immunization data by antigen, but does so at the country, region, and global level.
