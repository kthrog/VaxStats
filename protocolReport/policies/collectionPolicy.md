## Collection Policy
The VaxStats repository is a submissions-based repository, focused on collecting data about required vaccinations / immunizations for school-aged children in the Pacific Northwest states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. This repository also collects related data, such as information about vaccination legislation for children in those states. If you have data to contribute on these topics, please continue reading about our [ingest](https://github.com/kthrog/VaxStats/edit/master/protocolReport/policies/ingestPolicy.md) and [deposit](https://github.com/kthrog/VaxStats/edit/master/protocolReport/policies/depositPolicy.m) policies. 

We do _not_ accept the following data at this time: 
- Data about adults
- Data exclusively about non-required vaccinations, such as influenza vaccines
- Data outside the states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington
- Extremely sensitive data containing personally identifiable information about human subjects
