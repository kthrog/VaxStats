## Ingest Policy

Before proposing a new dataset to VaxStats, review the following data requirements. 

VaxStats data must be: 

| Requirement | Description | 
| ---         | ---         |
| *Machine-Readable* | VaxStats data must be machine-readable, and in at least one of the following formats: CSV, XML, RDF, and/or JSON. |
| *Human-Readable* | VaxStats data must be human-readable, which means it must have adequate descriptions to make it interpretable and reusable. |
| *Licensed* | VaxStats data will be automatically licensed CC-0, unless another type of license (such as CC-BY) is found to be acceptable. |
| *Secure* | All data submitted to VaxStats must honor the anonymity of human subjects, and be certified as having made every reasonable effort to remove personally identifiable information from the dataset(s). |
| *Verified* | Data integrity should be validated with checksums, to ensure against errors. |

These policies are in place so that VaxStats data adhere to the FAIR principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. In addition to these principles, the VaxStats repository also emphasizes **trust**, in recognition of the sensitive nature of medical vaccination data about children.
